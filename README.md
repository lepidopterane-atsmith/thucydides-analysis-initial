how to use thucy_crossref_feature
- edit speech_refs to include all chapters you're looking at. '1.6.' will include every section of book 1 chapter 6.
- if cross-analyzing with gorman treebanks, check what in your range is covered by which gorman xml files, make sure those files are specified in the token harvesting calls
- I really could have made this read in speech_refs from a config file but I was too lazy for that. perhaps this feature will happen sometime this summer shrug
